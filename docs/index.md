**LinkedUp is designed for university student leaders** including club presidents, society executives, event organizers, student council members, and committee heads who manage extensive networks of contacts across campus and beyond. These users typically manage 50-500+ contacts including fellow students, faculty advisors, alumni mentors, corporate sponsors, venue coordinators, and partner organization representatives.

**LinkedUp empowers student leaders to organize their professional networks efficiently through fast, typing-based commands.**
